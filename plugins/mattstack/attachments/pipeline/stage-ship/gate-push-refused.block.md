# Off-script gate: git_push refused

The gate protocol's Off-script gate (scope `off-script:ship:<n>`, `n`
shared with the evidence include's upload gate, `context` quoting the
refusal): `action` Take (the push outside `git_push` the gate recorded) or
Hand back (a failure, the refusal its reason); `next` Proceed, Iterate
here (the human fixed the cause) or Hold (no move). Read `next` first:
only Proceed applies `action`; retrying `git_push` is Iterate, never Take.
Iterate counts nothing: each retry needs a new answer at this gate.
