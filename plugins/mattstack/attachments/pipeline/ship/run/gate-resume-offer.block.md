# ship gate clarify: the Resume offer

`run_enter` returned `candidates`; never read the run dbs by hand. Gate
`clarify`: one sentence naming each candidate's `spawnedBy`, `startedAt`
and `currentStage`, then one **Resume** option per candidate (`Resume
(Recommended)` when `ownSession` is true; a run another live pane owns is
not yours) / **Start fresh**, and **Hold** in `next`. Resume passes that
candidate's `runId`.
