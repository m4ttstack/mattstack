# Off-script gate

A host STOP opens it through the graph: scope `off-script:<site>:<n>` (`n`
from 1 within the site's attempt), `context` quoting the refusal or the
line asking for the move.

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| `action` | **Take the proposed move** (its value spells the whole move) / **Hand back** |
| `next` | **Proceed** (Recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold** |

Take: make exactly that move once, then continue from the node it led to.
Hand back: the site's own hand-back edge where its graph draws one; otherwise, under a run, `run_stage {action: fail}` with the why as reason;
with no run, end the verb quoting it.
