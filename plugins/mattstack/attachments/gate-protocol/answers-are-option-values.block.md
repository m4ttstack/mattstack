# Answers are option values

An answer to a question with options is one of its option VALUES verbatim
(an array on a multi), never an index, label or paraphrase. Nuance rides
`{"value": ..., "note": "..."}`; an edited replacement for offered text
rides `text`, which the in-pane form never sends. The verb's act step
decides what either changes. A `writeIn: true` question may instead take
`{"writeIn": "<their words>"}` alone.
