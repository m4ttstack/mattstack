# Runs integration

A site that says "run gate-protocol's Runs integration with kind `<k>` and
these questions" enters at the trigger and walks every branch. Under a run
every gate tool call passes `runDb` and the site's `stage`: the tools
bracket the gate, arm `waiting-gate` on a wait, record the answers map
(`decidedBy` the CAS winner) and clear the marker. Without them the stop
hook bounces the turn. With no run, omit both; nothing here calls a `run_*`
tool.

- **Every site is on the tools.** No host brackets a gate with
  `run_field_set {key: gate}` or records its answer with a `run_decision`
  gate@1 line: the tools record the answers map (a write-in as `{"writeIn": "<their
  words>"}` in that question's slot), and `Selection:` lines only name its
  keys. The board's wrappers run under no run, so they pass neither.
- **Review shapes.** `gate_answer` and `gate_reconcile` record nothing on a
  review gate (`respond-plan`, `respond-post`, `review-post`, scope `post`)
  unless passed `record: true`; the site records with `gate_record`.
