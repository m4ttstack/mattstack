# gate_reconcile status?

It re-reads the gate (up to 2 seconds), records the answer under a run and
clears `waiting-gate`; never a timed `rt gate wait` or a hand record. Late
means `alreadyReconciled`, a `skipped` naming a stale gate, or, with no run,
a gate this pane already acted on. Otherwise `answered` is the decision, and
words in hand lose to it. `open` with words: map them and let
`gate_answer`'s CAS decide; with none, end the turn again (the wait and
marker stand). A daemon-unreachable refusal takes the daemon-down branch,
quoting it.
