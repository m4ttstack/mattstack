# gate_ask result?

**ok:** keep `id`, `paneAction`, `formContext` and `formChunks`;
`labelsTruncated` lists labels the tool shortened, so never shorten one
yourself. **`runErrors`:** the gate is open but a run write failed: quote it
in one line and carry on at `paneAction?`, never re-asking the gate or
writing that field yourself.
