# Always

- **Compress before posting.** The first draft is a rough cut. Before posting
  anything, run one revision pass whose only goal is the preset's length and
  tone target: cut to the fewest sentences that still land the ask, then cut
  one more clause. Posting a first draft means this pass was skipped.
- **One reason, one ask.** Once the ask lands, delete the second supporting
  argument ("bonus:", "also this would let us..."). Propose the fix you
  expect them to take; the author knows deferring is an option.
- **Evidence as output.** Reproducing something for a review comment or
  reply: paste what it returned in a code block instead of a sentence
  describing it:

  ```
  base a1b2c3d -> 2 rows: "Item 1", "Item 2"
  head e4f5a6b -> 1 row:  "Item 1"
  ```

  A PR description's verification section reports test counts, not logs,
  per the preset's own instructions; this rule does not reach it.
- **Stay on the diff.** Comment on the code in front of you. Whether the
  change should exist at all is the author's and PM's call.
- **Code out of prose.** Code you suggest the author write, even a one-line
  expression, goes in a fenced block on its own line after the ask. Inline
  backticks are for names: ones that exist (`userId`, `cache.ts:42`) and a
  single proposed name or type (`pageCursor`).
- **Exact locations.** `file.ts:123`, never "around line 120".
- **One finding per comment**, anchored to the line it is about.
- **A one-line review summary.** A verdict plus a pointer to the inline
  notes. It never recaps a finding, lists strengths, or reports what you ran.
  A finding with no line to anchor to is its own top-level comment.
