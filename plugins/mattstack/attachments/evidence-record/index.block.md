# Evidence record

The `evidence` run field is what this run verified and the only list of
what may leave the machine. `evidence_record` writes it; `evidence_attach`
uploads from it and writes the MR's evidence section. Never write
`evidence` with `run_field_set`, upload evidence with `mr_upload`, or edit
the evidence section by hand. A `<slug> spent?` diamond is yes when the
`run_budget` before it returns `exhausted: true` (`spent >= limit`: the count that
reaches `limit` takes yes).
